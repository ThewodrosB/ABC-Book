## ABC-scrum-github-activity ##

- [Here is a link to this README.md in the browser, you will be able to see the pictures there.](https://github.com/reanderson89/jfs-den2-activity-bank/tree/main/01-git-github-scrum/04-Scrum-Github-ABC-Activity)

- In this activity your group is tasked to create the ABC's by finding images from the web and adding them to the index.html file to display them all. 

- The photos that you find need to be linked using the web address for the image to the "src" attribute in the "img" tags in the index.html file.

- Letters A and B have already been completed. Use them as a reference for all other letters you have to complete. 

- You do not have to add any additional HTML code, you just need to add text inside of the existing "h1", "h3" tags and the "src" attributes inside of the "img" tags.

## Begin this activity by... ##

- One person will need to create a repository and then add their team members as collaborators. While in your repository on github go to "Settings > Collaborators > Add People" and then search for your teammates by name or email. They will be sent an email to join the repo, they will need to open the email and follow the link to become an active member of the repo.

- Whoever created the repo needs to add security to the main branch. Go to "Settings > Branches > Add Rule". In the Add Rule page you will need to type "main" in the "Branch Name Pattern" text box at the top. make sure your settings look like this image, and remember that it is case sensitive... "Main" does not equal "main". After you have everything selected like the image below click the green "Create" button.

- Copy the necessary files and folders to your project (index.html, README.md), then read the entire README before moving on.

- Your team should create a project board and then create an issue for EVERY letter. This is repetitive, and is meant to be used as practice. Start your first sprint by prioritizing the first items(letters), once everyone is done with their letter, close the issues and then move to the next letters.

- Practice branching in your repository by creating a new branch for every letter that you work on. For example if you personally get tasked with letter C, then create a branch called "letterC". Once you finish that letter and are done with the branch, make sure to create a new branch for your next letter. For example, if you are next tasked with letter F your branch would be "letterF".

## Useful commands for creating and moving to branches...
    - `git branch` (shows current local branches)
    - `git branch branchName` (creates a new branch)
    - `git checkout branchName` (moves you to the branch listed)
    - `git checkout -b branchName` (creates a new branch and moves you to it)

## How to push a branch... 
    - `git status`
    - `git add .`
    - `git commit -m 'message'`
    - `git status`
    - `git pull origin main`
    - `git push origin branchName`
